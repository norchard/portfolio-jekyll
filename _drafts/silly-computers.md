### Rainy Days: [The Etymology of the Mach Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)#Name)
Mach's name evolved in a euphemization spiral: While the developers, once during the naming phase, had to bike to lunch through rainy Pittsburgh's mud puddles, Tevanian joked the word muck could serve as apronym (a portmanteau of "a propos acronym") for their Multi-User [or Multiprocessor Universal] Communication Kernel. Italian CMU engineer Dario Giuse later asked project leader Rick Rashid about the project's current title and received "MUCK" as the answer, though not spelled out but just pronounced as IPA: [mʌk] which he, according to the Italian alphabet, wrote as Mach. Rashid liked Giuse's spelling "Mach" so much that it prevailed.

### A Side Project: [Named Email]()

These two methods are known as little-endian (the Intel way) and big-endian (the Motorola way). It might be fun to argue over which method is better, but before you do so, be aware that the term Big-
Endian comes from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels and refers to the war between Lilliput and Blefuscu over which end of an egg to break before eating it. The novel describes an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over the practice of breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor's great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the smaller end after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end.
