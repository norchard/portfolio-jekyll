  	<h3>Branding</h3>
  	<p>Kulen Outreach needed a logomark that reflected the curiousity and enthusiasm of the kids in Phnom Kulen. The mark pays homage to the Cambodian flag, honoring tradition and heritage, while looking to a future brightened by foundational learning. The color palette is a nod to the lychee fruit - the namesake of Phnom Kulen.</p>

  	<h3>Information Architecture and Visual Design</h3>
  	<p>For an organization based in Cambodia, a website is an invaluable communication tool. Kulen Outreach's website was designed to facilitate easy access to information for potential donors and volunteers. High quality photography is featured on a large scale, giving users a sense of the real impact Kulen Outreach is making for the children of Phnom Kulen.</p>
